###### My favourite food is Chicken Biryani
> As a matter of fact, i do love to taste all kinds of foods. However, if i have to choose one from the stereotype foods, **I love to eat chicken biryani.** It is the most popular dish of the place where I belong to.Chicken Biryani is prepared from basmati rice mixed with spices and chicken which adds flavour to the dish.
