## About Me
> I'm graduated from Guru Nanak Institutions in the stream of "ECE". After graduation, I've stated working as a "Process Executive" in Cognizant Technology Solutions. While working, I've realised my passion towards learning new technologies. So, I decided to do my masters in Applied computer Science at NWMSU.
